abstract: >
  This study employed multimodal connectome-based predictive modeling to predict suicide risk in patients with late-life depression. Using both resting-state functional connectivity and white matter structural connectivity, the authors identified brain network patterns that predicted suicide risk with up to 30% explained variance. These multimodal brain features improved classification accuracy beyond standard questionnaire measures and were validated across two independent datasets. The findings highlight the potential of brain connectivity as biomarkers for suicide risk screening and clinical intervention in late-life depression.

summary: >
  Brain connectivity patterns from fMRI and DTI data can predict suicide risk in late-life depression with improved accuracy over behavioral assessments alone.
